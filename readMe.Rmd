I embarked on this project to better understanding scraping data from Twitter. The in this repository do the following

1) Pull data from Twitter related to #netDE
2) Wrangle the data into a usable data.frame
3) Plot into a few meaningful charts
4) Create a wordcload
5) Do a sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the tweets.
